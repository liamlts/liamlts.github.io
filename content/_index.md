        My research centers on quantum materials characterization using synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopies. I investigate altermagnetism, van der Waals magnets, frustrated magnetic systems, and magnetocaloric materials at major international facilities including ESRF, Diamond Light Source, SOLEIL, MAX IV, and NSLS-II. I also pursue legal studies focused on energy and environmental policy.
